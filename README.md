### Hi there üëã

I'm a data engineer based in Paris. I'm very passionate about open-source projects and enjoy building data pipelines, datalakes, and data services - basically, I enjoy working with data and designing scalable solutions.

I'm currently working on AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è and leveraging multiple open-source tools in different data and ML projects (mostly working with Glue, Spark, SageMaker, and Apache Superset).

I try to post frequently on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mahdikarabiben) and [my personal website](https://mahdiqb.github.io/).


### The technologies I'm most familiar with:
- Apache Spark: I've been using it on a daily basis for more than three years (and so we know each other pretty well)
- AWS Ecosystem: Have been working on it for the past year, and it has already made me enjoy my morning coffee a bit more ‚òï
- Hadoop: Worked with Hadoop datalakes for two years and a half (was mostly a rough ride, but lots of lessons/experience learned thanks to it)
- Other projects/tools: Apache Superset, Apache Airflow, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Hive, Dremio, Databricks, Jupyter
- AWS tools I'm using on a daily basis: Athena, EMR, Glue, S3, SageMaker, ECS, Fargate, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and the list goes on... 
- IaC: Terraform and CloudFormation
- Languages I'm fluent in: Python, Java, SQL
