### Hi there 👋

I'm Mahdi, a PM building products in the data space. Before transitioning to product, I spent seven years designing and building petabyte-scale data platforms wearing different hats (data engineer, tech lead, data architect, and ML Ops engineer). I'm very passionate about open-source projects and enjoy working with data and designing scalable solutions. You can also read my content on [Medium](https://mahdiqb.medium.com/) and via [the Data Espresso newsletter](https://dataespresso.substack.com/).


### The technologies I'm most familiar with:
- Apache Spark: I used it on a daily basis for nearly four years (and so we know each other pretty well).
- dbt: It's the tool I'm working with the most currently. I'm mainly working on defining and implementing standards, frameworks, and automation to better leverage dbt at scale. ([Article from the Zendesk Engineering blog](https://zendesk.engineering/dbt-at-zendesk-part-i-setting-foundations-for-scalability-34b55e6a6aa1))
- AWS Ecosystem: Worked on it for 2 years, for various data and ML projects (mostly worked with Glue, EMR, Athena, ECS, SageMaker, and the AWS CI/CD stack).
- GCP Ecosystem: Using it currently on a daily basis (mostly working with BigQuery and GKE).
- Hadoop: Worked with Hadoop data lakes for two and a half years (it was the ecosystem that first introduced me to distributed systems and the paradigms/concepts behind them).
- Other notable projects/tools: Apache Superset, Apache Airflow, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Hive, Dremio, Databricks, Jupyter, and D3.js.
- Languages I'm fluent in: Python, Java, and SQL.
- Other languages I used in the past: C++, C#, JavaScript (Angular, Node.js), and HTML+CSS.
- IaC: Terraform and CloudFormation.


### Notable published work:
- [End-to-End Batch Data Pipeline with Spark](https://www.manning.com/liveprojectseries/batch-data-pipeline-with-spark): A series of four projects that I authored for Manning Publications as part of their liveProjects platform. The series goes through the different steps of building an end-to-end Big Data pipeline. Learners get to use Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Apache Superset.
- [Building an End-to-End Open-Source Modern Data Platform](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-an-end-to-end-open-source-modern-data-platform-c906be2f31bd): Proposes an exhaustive design (accompanied by the necessary Infrastructure-as-Code) to build a modern data platform solely using open-source projects and the resources offered by cloud providers.
- [Writing design docs for data pipelines](https://towardsdatascience.com/writing-design-docs-for-data-pipelines-d49550f95580): Exploring the what, why, and how of design docs for data components — and why they matter.
