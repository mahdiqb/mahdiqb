### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mahdi, a data engineer based in Paris. I'm very passionate about open-source projects and enjoy building data pipelines, data lakes, and data services - basically, I enjoy working with data and designing scalable solutions.


I try to meaningfully contribute to the discussion around data engineering via [Medium](https://mahdiqb.medium.com/) and [the Data Espresso newsletter](https://dataespresso.substack.com/).


### The technologies I'm most familiar with:
- Apache Spark: I've been using it on a daily basis for nearly four years (and so we know each other pretty well).
- AWS Ecosystem: Worked on it for 2 years, for various data and ML projects (mostly worked with Glue, EMR, Athena, ECS, SageMaker, and the AWS CI/CD stack).
- GCP Ecosystem: Using it currently on a daily basis (mostly working with BigQuery and GKE).
- Hadoop: Worked with Hadoop data lakes for two and a half years (was mostly a rough ride, but lots of lessons/experience learned thanks to it).
- Other notable projects/tools: Apache Superset, Apache Airflow, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Hive, Dremio, Databricks, Jupyter, and D3.js.
- Languages I'm fluent in: Python, Java, and SQL.
- Other languages I've used in the past: C++, C#, JavaScript (Angular, Node.js), and HTML+CSS.
- IaC: Terraform and CloudFormation.


### Notable published work:
- [End-to-End Batch Data Pipeline with Spark](https://www.manning.com/liveprojectseries/batch-data-pipeline-with-spark): A series of four projects that I authored for Manning Publications as part of their liveProjects platform. The series goes through the different steps of building an end-to-end Big Data pipeline while using Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Apache Superset.
- [Building an End-to-End Open-Source Modern Data Platform](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-an-end-to-end-open-source-modern-data-platform-c906be2f31bd): Proposes an exhaustive design (accompanied by the necessary Infrastructure-as-Code) for building a modern data platform solely using open-source projects and the resources offered by cloud providers.
- [Creating Notebook-based Dynamic Dashboards](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-notebook-based-dynamic-dashboards-91f936adc6f3): A design (accompanied by a POC) in which notebooks are leveraged to generate dynamic dashboards, to support a Google-like metadata search engine.
