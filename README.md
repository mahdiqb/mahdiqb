### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer based in Paris. I'm very passionate about open-source projects and enjoy building data pipelines, data lakes, and data services - basically, I enjoy working with data and designing scalable solutions.


I try to post frequently on [Medium](https://mahdiqb.medium.com/) and [my personal website](https://mahdiqb.github.io/).


### The technologies I'm most familiar with:
- Apache Spark: I've been using it on a daily basis for nearly four years (and so we know each other pretty well).
- AWS Ecosystem: Worked on it for 2 years, for various data and ML projects (mostly worked with Glue, EMR, Athena, ECS, SageMaker, and the AWS CI/CD stack).
- Hadoop: Worked with Hadoop data lakes for two years and a half (was mostly a rough ride, but lots of lessons/experience learned thanks to it).
- Other notable projects/tools: Apache Superset, Apache Airflow, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Hive, Dremio, Databricks, Jupyter, and D3.js.
- IaC: Terraform and CloudFormation.
- Languages I'm fluent in: Python, Java, and SQL.
